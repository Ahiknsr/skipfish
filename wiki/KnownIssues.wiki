#summary Known issues in skipfish

=Common problems with skipfish=

*Note: [http://code.google.com/p/skipfish/wiki/SkipfishDoc click here] for general project documentation. This document covers some frequently asked issues with _skipfish_ only.*

==Problem #1: Compilation fails==

The most common reason for problems is that you do not have a properly configured build environment. Please make sure that you have the following components - and their dependencies - installed:

  * [http://gcc.gnu.org/ GNU C Compiler]
  * [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ GNU Make]
  * [http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/ GNU C Library] (including development headers)
  * [http://www.zlib.net/ zlib] (including development headers)
  * [http://www.openssl.org/ OpenSSL] (including development headers)
  * [http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/ libidn] (including development headers)

All the development headers must be in your default include path; several vendors mess this up, in which case, you might need to locate the file using `find`, and provide additional `-I/path/to/inclue/files/` options in `CFLAGS`.

Several people also reported problems compiling on certain versions of FreeBSD (but many others had no issues whatsoever). A potential workaround is to edit `alloc-inl.h`, and put this:

{{{
#include <malloc_np.h>
}}}

...right after the `#include <stdlib.h>` line. If you had this problem and the workaround helped, please let me know.

==Problem #2: My scan takes forever==

The first thing to check is the number of requests per second displayed by the scanner. It should be at least 200 req/s when scanning remote targets on the Internet, and at least 1000 req/s on local networks. If it is significantly lower, your problem might be just a very slow server; in this case, try changing the `-m` parameter to see if it helps; wait a bit longer; or modify dictionary settings as outlined in `dictionaries/README-FIRST` to reduce the number of requests sent.

If the reported scan speed is adequate, but the scan of a relatively small site is still taking hours, you can abort it with `Ctrl-C` and examine the generated report. If you notice recursive, nonsensical nodes in the output, or other significant abnormalities, follow the [http://code.google.com/p/skipfish/wiki/SkipfishDoc#Oy!_Something_went_horribly_wrong! logging build instructions] and contact me to have this fixed. In the meantime, you can use `-r` and `-d` options to set crawl limits, or `-X` to exclude problematic locations.

If something else seems to be wrong, or if the scanner simply crashes, follow the [http://code.google.com/p/skipfish/wiki/SkipfishDoc#Oy!_Something_went_horribly_wrong! general troubleshooting instructions] and send me a log file.

==Problem #3: I ran it against a "demo" vulnerable application, and...==

Simulated vulnerable applications are usually very simplistic; consider [http://zero.webappsecurity.com/rootlogin.asp.bak this example] from SPI Dynamics: the script responds to certain predefined path inclusion attempts, e.g. `/etc/passwd`, but not to other, possibly smarter probes.

Since journalists and novice users tend to use these test sites as a benchmark for tested products, commercial vendors generally try to account for how these demo sites are designed. With `skipfish`, this seemed to be not particularly productive.

==Problem #4: I'm running into display issues==

If your terminal is set to use a non-standard palette or a non-standard color scheme (e.g., black-on-white), `skipfish` output may be harder to read, or may revert your custom settings. If this is a problem, edit `config.h` and comment out the `USE_COLORS` line, then recompile.

If your terminal is set to 80x25, `skipfish` statistics may not fit neatly. If this is the case, please resize to at least 100x35.

==Problem #5: I can't view the report in Safari or Chrome==

This is likely because you browsed to the report via `file:///`. Certain important security improvements implemented in these browsers have the unfortunate side effect of crippling local Java<b></b>Script. Please put the report in a local WWW root and navigate to `http://localhost/...` instead (or use Firefox).
